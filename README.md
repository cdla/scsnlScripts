# scsnlscripts

Welcome to the repo containing all standard Stanford Cognitive Systems Lab scripts! Our primary scripting language is matlab, and all scripts are currently working and executable for matlab 2017a/b on Sherlock 2.0 (Stanford HPC).

# Best Practices:

If you would like to run a script, do so through the mlsubmit system.
